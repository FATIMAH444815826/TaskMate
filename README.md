Developing a Gantt chart for the project schedule is an excellent way to visualize task dependencies and manage project timelines effectively. Here's an example of a Gantt chart for your smart monitoring application project:

Regarding the project specifications, it's important to review and revise both functional and non-functional requirements as needed throughout the project. This ensures that the application meets the desired goals and performance criteria. Be sure to involve stakeholders, such as the development team, project managers, and end-users, to gather feedback and make appropriate revisions.

As for the user guide, it should provide comprehensive instructions on how to use the smart monitoring application. It should cover topics such as installation, setup, configuration, and usage of the various features and functionalities. The user guide should be written in a clear and concise manner, using language that is easily understandable by the target audience.

Remember to update the project schedule and other project documentation as the project progresses and new information becomes available. Regularly monitor and adjust the Gantt chart to reflect the actual progress of tasks and ensure that the project stays on track.
